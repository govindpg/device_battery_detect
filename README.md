# device_battery_detect
its a simple web application that tells the  device battery,wheather it is being charging or not and a pictorial represention of the charging  level.
it is using getBattery api to fetch the device battery and it tells wheather it is charging or not.

ps;- as of now some of browsers doesnt support this api thus it will not able to display the info correctly(brave.....).
